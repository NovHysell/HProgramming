Ode to Python

In the quiet glow of midnight screens,
Where fingers dance on keys unseen,
A language whispers, soft and clean—
Python, the serpent of my dreams.

No braces bind the logic's flow,
Just indents pure as fallen snow.
With colon's grace, the blocks bestow
A structure that the heart can know.

def awaken_ideas(spark):
    """Ignite the mind with code's bright arc."""
    for line in inspiration:
        yield creativity * spark

Variables slither, sleek and sly,
Lists comprehend what commas imply.
Dictionaries map the reasons why
The world fits neatly, by and by.

import numpy as np, pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
# Plot the chaos into ordered art.

Try, except—the errors caught,
With gentle raise when things are naught.
Finally, the truth is wrought:
Perfection in the bugs we fought.

class PoetCoder:
    def __init__(self, passion):
        self.heart = passion
    def write(self, stanza):
        return f"{stanza}\n\t—crafted in loops of light."

while True:
    print("Hello, World!")
    if joy > bugs:
        continue
    else:
        break  # Until the dawn.

In virtual realms where functions call,
Lambdas dart like fireflies small.
Async awaits the future's thrall—
Python, you hold me in your thrall.

And when the script at last compiles,
No errors left, just weary smiles,
We push to Git, through stormy trials—
The poem lives, in endless files.
